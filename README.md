This repository maintains a number of examples of how to build and test WASM binaries from various source languages. Each example package contains a README with documentation and instructions for use:

### C

- [Addition](examples/c/add) - Add two numbers and return the result. Also demonstrates persistence of  contract state across calls
- [Types](examples/c/types) - Demonstrates submitting and working with types in C + JS

### AssemblyScript

- [Addition](examples/assemblyscript/add) - Add two numbers and return the result. Also demonstrates persistence of  contract state across calls
- [Types](examples/assemblyscript/types) - Demonstrates submitting and working with types and return values in AssemblyScript + JS
